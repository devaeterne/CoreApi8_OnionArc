# BookCar Project with Asp.Net Core Api 8 + Onion Architecture
## CQRS - Mediator - Repository Design Patterns and a Real Project with JWT - SignalR Topics!



I've been working on a course for a long time, and it's almost ready â€“ almost, because the course duration is quite long, so I'm continuing with the recordings. I will revise this text when I share the final lesson. Hopefully, I'll share the final lesson within the next two weeks. The goal of this course is to explain the Onion Architecture through AspNet Core Api. In addition to Onion Architecture, you will see various design patterns in this course. In terms of architecture, we used Onion in our course and included the following design patterns:

CQRS
Mediator
Repository
We built our scenario around a "Car Rental" system, and the title that gave our project and course its name came from our theme. The expression "BookCar," our theme name, also became the name of our project.

To develop this project, you will need some prerequisites. It's not quite right to start this project without them, as you may struggle a lot and leave things hanging. Your requirement here should definitely be that you have previously developed an AspNet Core project, and if possible, an Api project. If you have worked on this, you have come to the right content to see new architecture and design patterns.

Additionally, in our course, we cover topics such as:

Json Web Token
SignalR
Pivot Table
Dto
Fluent Validation
The course has a rich content. When it finishes, you will leave very satisfied. If you have any questions, you can always write to me. I will respond to your messages whenever I'm available. If you are ready, let's start the lessons. Prepare your teas and coffees, let's take the first step.
